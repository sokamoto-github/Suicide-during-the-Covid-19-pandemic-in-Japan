2.	Data and Code Structure <br>
data: <br>
･	raw data: All raw data for analyses and figures are stored in the “raw_data” folder. <br>
･	do_file: Once they are processed in the form of do.file (statistical software STATA), they are stored in the “do_file” folder. <br>
･	working_data: The folder “working_data” includes the master data for the analyses. Some data (i.e. city_station.dta and working_data.dta) are stored as zip files due to their large file sizes. <br>
<br>
code:  <br>
･	1_data_create: Using this code, we processed the raw data. <br>
･	2_merge_variable: we merge the data and create variables <br>
･	3_analyses: we created all the figures and tables in the main text, extended data figures, and supplementary materials. <br>
figures: This includes all the figures in the form of do.file, png, eps, and pdf <br>
tables: This includes the spreadsheet representing the tables <br>
